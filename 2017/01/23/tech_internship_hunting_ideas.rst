Tech Internship Hunting Ideas
=============================

A question from a computer science student crossed one of my IRC channels
recently::

    Them: what is the best way to fish for internships over the summer?
        Glassdoor?

    Me: It depends on what kind of internship you're looking for. What kind of
        internship are you looking for?

    Them: Computer Science, anything really.

This caused me to type out a lot of advice. I'll restate and elaborate on it
here, so that I can provide a more timely and direct summary if the question
comes up again.

Philosophy of Job Hunting
-------------------------

My opinion on job hunting, especially for early-career technologists, is that
it's important to get multiple offers whenever possible. Only once one has a
viable alternative can one be said to truly choose a role, rather than being
forced into it by financial necessity.

In my personal experience, cultivating multiple offers was an important step
in disentangling impostor syndrome from my career choices. Multiple data
points about one's skills being valued by others can help balance out an
internal monologue about how much one has yet to learn.

If you disagree that cultivating simulataneous opportunities then politely
declining all but the best is a viable internship hunting strategy, the rest
of this post may not be relevant or interesting to you.

Identifying Your Options
------------------------

To get an internship offer, you need to make a **compelling application** to a
**company which might hire you**. I find that a useful first step is to come
up with a list of such companies, so you can study their needs and determine
what will make your application interest them.

**Use your social network**. Ask your peers about what internships they've had or
applied for. Ask your mentors whether they or their friends and colleagues
hire interns.

When you ask someone about their experience with a company, remember to ask
for their opinion of it. To put that opinion into perspective, it's useful to
also ask about their personal preferences for what they enjoy or hate about a
workplace. Knowing that someone who prefers to work with a lot of background
noise enjoyed a company's busy open-plan office can be extremely useful if you
need silence to concentrate! Listening with interest to a person's opinions
also strengthens your social bond with them, which never hurts if it turns out
they can help you get into a company that you feel might be a good fit.

**Use LinkedIn, Hacker News, Glassdoor, and your city's job boards**. The
broader a net you cast to start with, the better your chances of eventually
finding somewhere that you enjoy. If your job hunt includes certain fields
(web dev, DevOps, big data, whatever), investigate whether there's a meetup
for professionals in that field in your region. If you have the opportunity to
give a short talk on a personal project at such a meetup, do it and make sure
to mention that you're looking for an internship.

Identify your own priorities
----------------------------

Now that you have a list of places which might concievably want to hire you,
it's time to do some **introspection**.  For each field that you've found a
prospective company in, try to answer the question **"What makes you excited
about working here?"**.

You do not have to have know what you want to do with your life to know that,
right now, you think DevOps or big data or frontend development is cool.

You do not have to personally commit to a single passion at the expense of all
others -- it's perfectly fine to be interested in several different languages
or frameworks, even if the tech media tries to pit them against each other.

However, for each application, it's prudent to only emphasize your interests
in that particular field. It's a bit of a faux pas to show up to a helpdesk
interview and focus the whole time on your passion for building robots, or
vice versa. And acting equally interested in every other field will cause an
employer to doubt that you're necessarily the best fit for a specialized
role... So in an interview, try not to stray too far from the **value that
you're able to deliver** to that company.

This is also a good time to identify any **deal-breakers** that would cause
you to decline a prospective internship. Are you ok with relocating? Is there
some tool or technology that would cause you to dread going to work every day?

I personally think that it's worth applying even to a role that you know you
wouldn't accept an offer from when you're early in your career. If they decide
to interview you, you'll get practice experiencing a real interview without
the pressure of "I'll lose my chance at my dream job if I mess this up!". Plus
if they extend an offer to you, it can help you calibrate the financial value
of your skills and negotiate with employers that you'd actually enjoy.

Craft an excellent resume
-------------------------

I talk about this `elsewhere <http://edunham.net/tags/resume.html>`_.

There are a couple extra notes if you're applying for an internship:

1) Emphasize the parts of your experience that relate most closely to what
each employer values. If you can, it's great to use the same words for skills
that were used in the job description.

2) The bar for what skills go on your resume is lower when you have less
experience. Did you play with Docker for a weekend recently and use it to
deploy a toy app? Make sure to include that experience.

Practice, Practice, Practice
----------------------------

If you're uncomfortable with interviewing, do it until it becomes second
nature. If your current boss supports your internship search, do some mock
interviews with them. If you're nervous about things going wrong, have a
friend roleplay as a really bad interview with you to help you practice coping
strategies. If you'll be in front of a panel of interviewers, try to get a
panel of friends to gang up on you and ask tough questions!

To some readers this may be obvious, but to others it's worth pointing out
that you should also **practice wearing the clothes** that you'll wear to an
interview. If you wear a tie, learn to tie it well. If you wear shirts or
pants that need to be ironed, learn to iron them comptently. If you wear shoes
that need to be shined, learn to shine them. And if your interview will
include lunch, learn to eat with good table manners and avoid spilling food on
yourself.

Yes, the day-to-day dress codes of many tech offices are solidly in the
"sneakers, jeans, and t-shirt" category for employees of all levels and
genders. But many interviewers, especially mid- to late-career folks, grew up
in an age when dressing casually at an interview was a sign of incompetence or
disrespect. Although some may make an effort to overcome those biases, the
subconscious conditioning is often still there, and you can take advantage of
it by wearing at least business casual.

Apply Everywhere
----------------

If you know someone at a company where you're applying, try to get their
feedback on how you can tailor your resume to be the best fit for the job
you're looking at! They might even be able to introduce you personally to your
potential future boss.

I think it's worth submitting a good resume to every company which you
identify as being possibly interested in your skills, even the ones you don't
currently think you want to work for. Interview practice is worth more in
potential future salary than the hours of your time it'll take at this point
in your career.

Follow Up
---------

If you don't hear back from a company for a couple weeks, a polite note is
order. Restate your enthusiasm for their company or field, express your
understanding that there are a lot of candidates and everything is busy, and
politely solicit any feedback that they may be able to offer about your
application. A delayed reply does not always mean rejection.

If you're rejected, follow up to thank HR for their time.

If you're invited to interview, reply promptly and set a time and date. For a
virtual or remote interview, only offer times when you'll have access to a
quiet room with a good network connection.

Interview Excellently
---------------------

I don't have any advice that you won't find a hundred times over on the rest
of the web. The key points are:

* Show up on time, looking respectable
* Let's hope you didn't lie on your resume
* Restate each question in your answer
* It's ok not to know an answer -- state what you would do if you encountered
  the problem at work. Would you Google a certain phrase? Ask a colleague?
  Read the manual?
* Always ask questions at the end. When in doubt, ask your interviewer what
  they enjoy about working for the company.

Keep Following Up
-----------------

After your interview, write to whoever arranged it and thank the interviewers
for their time. For bonus points, mention something that you talked about in
the interview, or include the answer to a question that you didn't know off
the top of your head at the time.

Getting an Offer
----------------

Recruiters don't usually like to disclose the details of offers in writing
right away. They'll often phone you to talk about it. You do not have to
accept or decline during that first call -- if you're trying to stall for a
bit more time for another company to get back to you, an excuse like "I'll
have to run that by my family to make sure those details will work" is often
safe.

Remember, though, that **no offer is really a job until both you and the
employer have signed a contract**.

Declining Offers
----------------

If you've applied to enough places with a sufficiently compelling resume,
you'll probably have multiple offers. If you're lucky, they'll all arrive
around the same time.

If you wish to decline an offer from a company whom you're certain you don't
want to work for, you can practice your negotiation skills. Read up on salary
negotiation, try to talk the company into making you a better offer, and
observe what works and what doesn't. It's not super polite to invest a bunch
of their time in negotiations and then turn them down anyway, which is why I
suggest only doing this to a place that you're not very fond of.

To decline an offer without burning any bridges, be sure to thank them again
for their time and regretfully inform them that you'll be pursuing other
opportunities at this time. It never hurts to also do them a favor like
recommending a friend who's job hunting and might be a good fit.

Again, though, don't decline an offer until you have your actual job's
contract in writing.
