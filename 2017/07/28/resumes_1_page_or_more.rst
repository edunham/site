Resumes: 1 page or more?
========================

Some of my IRC friends are job hunting at the moment, so I've been
proofreading resumes. These friends are several years into their professional
careers at this point, and I've found it really interesting to see what they
include and exclude to make the best use of their resumes' space.

No wasted space
---------------

I've also stumbled into a rule of thumb that I like a lot better than the "1
page rule": The rule of **No Wasted Space**.

If you spread 1 page worth of stuff across 2 pages, you're wasting a page
worth of space. This forces any reader to spend 2 pages worth of time on your
1 page worth of content, which is an act of disrespect to them.

Big blank areas are a waste of space if they push your resume to more pages
than it needs to be. On the other side of that same coin, however, a bunch of
cramped small text wastes its space if it sacrifices easy legibility and
scannability for the sake of cramming everything relevant onto a single sheet.
And excess words where fewer would have communicated just as well are a waste
of ink, as well as interviewer time!

Number those pages
------------------

Resumes that run to multiple pages are vastly improved by a little note on the
corner of each: "Surname, Page X of Y".

"I existed!"
------------

I'm still surprised by how often people share awards and titles as "got X
award", "was President of Organization". I hold the opinion that identical
achievements sound much cooler with active rather than passive verbs: "Earned
X award", "Led Organization", etc.

Stuff in more numbers
---------------------

I'm a little annoyed by whatever cognitive bias is in play with this one:
People sound better at what they do when they stuff more numbers into their
descriptions, even when the numbers aren't objectively very useful or
necessary. "Tutored students" vs "Tutored 30 students", "Improved performance"
vs "Doubled performance", etc. This is another compelling reason to instrument
your systems and measure them before and after making major changes, which is
something I personally need to improve at work as well :)

The Mirror Trick
----------------

When you've been staring at a document for hours, it's really hard to take a
step back and tell what kind of first impression its formatting is going to
make. To counter this, make your resume in the format you expect an
interviewer to see it. Printed out or fullscreened on a laptop are common
choices. Then either make your computer flip it horizontally, or just hold it
up to a mirror and look at the reflection. This makes it look just new enough
that you can spot glaring formatting errors instead of just reading the
individual words -- "What's that enormous white space doing there?", "Wait why
is that indented to a different level from everything else?".
