title: Feel smarter than your peers with this one wierd trick! 
slug: specialties 
---

At the OSU Open Source Lab, I've worked with some of the best and most
experienced student sysadmins in the world. We work in a bafflingly diverse
mileiu of open source projects, and take our own and our peers' acquaintance
with nearly every major software tool for granted. By this I mean that you
could pick an arbitrary tool and the odds are very good that one of us, or a
client we've worked with directly, is knowledgeable about it. 

The downside to learning and working in this insular little community of high
achievers is that it's easy to feel like you, personally, aren't actually
contributing that much. One gets the feeling that for each of one's own
skills, a peer has that skill even better. 

The cool, hacky trick that circumvents a lot of these unfounded feelings of
inferiority is to pick a specialty. It barely matters what, but becoming the
best person in the lab at $SOMETHING_USEFUL will forcibly remind you of your
value to the team whenever your peers turn to you for help and advice. 

You do not have to know all of these, though enough superficial knowledge to
ask questions in the correct terms will help optimize your Google queries. 

Here are some ideas of specialties that you could adopt:

Version Control
---------------

Be the person who knows how to get out of a broken merge, how to rebase, how
to cherry-pick, and has the commit range syntax memorized. 

DNS
---

Know what fields go into a record, how the various records behave, and how to
look at sites' DNS for troubleshooting purposes.

Mail
----

Postfix is scary. Slay the dragon.

Mailman
-------

Familiarity with the internals would be great, but it turns out that just
knowing what's available in the UI and where to find it is a small superpower
in itself.

IRC Channel Management
----------------------

Know which bot to ping for help to get answers to a given question. Walk
newbies through setting topics and other channel managemetn tasks. 

IRC Client Configuration
------------------------

Fun facts like ``/lastlog`` are instant social karma. Add troubleshooting
skills for Irssi, Weechat, or ZNC, then voluntarily help others, and suddenly
you're viewed as a bit of a wizard.

Continuous Integration
----------------------

If Jenkins or even Travis likes you, you'll always be in demand by those
trying to set them up for the first time.
