Since there aren't enough web pages in the world, I made another one! It
started as the `wok <https://github.com/mythmon/wok>`_ test site, then I tore 
out the parts I didn't understand. 

You're probably here because you want to find out more about me either
personally or professionally. If you've managed to somehow invent a work
environment even better than `OSL <http://osuosl.org/>`_ or `Airship 
<http://urbanairship.com/>`_ and you're looking for sysadmins, check out `my 
resume <https://github.com/edunham/resume>`_. 

If you're looking for an interesting social media presence, I'm afraid you're
out of luck. I have Facebook, Google+, and LinkedIn profiles solely for
consuming others' information, mainly as a way to reassure myself that I'm not
missing out on anything by ignoring dozens of acquaintances.
