I have a Nexus 7 with a cell phone radio in it which I purchased new from
Google in August 2014. It's been sitting in various states of soft-brick from
when I first tried to install CyanogenMod on it until today. 

CyanogenMod
-----------

Cyanogen is an awesome, more-open-source alternative to the stock Android that
Google ships with their devices. I got a Nexus 5 in July or so, followed the
instructions for CyanogenMod on it, and got it working within an hour. This
caused me to mitsakenly believe that reinstalling the OS of the Nexus 7 would
be equally easy.

Codenames
---------

The first problem is that, while there's only one Nexus 7, there are
instructions online for 4 or more variants of the Nexus 7. There's the versions
where page titles specify "2013 model" vs where they don't state a year, and
there's wifi, LTE, GSM, or no information about what radios are inside. 

Mistake 1: Failure to read the bootloader
-----------------------------------------

On the Nexus 7, hold the reduce-volume button while briefly pressing the power
button, and it'll boot into the bootloader. This has useful information about
whether your device is a Deb or a Flo... mine appears to be Deb hardware with
a Flo bootloader?
