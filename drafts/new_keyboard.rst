New Keyboard
============

Wherein I complain about the Thinkpad X1 Carbon and share my impressions of
the Noppoo Spyder Lolita keyboard.

Backstory
---------

The chiclet keyboard of my Thinkpad X1 Carbon is tolerable. It took me about a
month of using it for a majority of my typing time to notice any annoyances.

The intractable problem with the X1's keyboard is that it fits into a tiny,
thin little laptop. Although the keys have nice little scissor switches in
them to elegantly convert lateral force into a keypress when necessary, they
do not travel very far. The combination of thin-ness and flat-ness required
for the Carbon's sleek design means that I find myself bottoming out
keystrokes when typing fast. After about a month of using the X1's keyboard as
my only input device for over 8 hours a day, my hands started occasionally
complaining about the ergonomics of the situation. 

The annoyance was trivial and intermittent enough that I bikeshedded for
almost another full month before bothering to acquire a mechanical keyboard. 

During my internship in 2014, Urban Airship provided me with a Das Keyboard
with Cherry MX Brown switches. Although it was much nicer than any chicklet
keyboard, I wasn't satisfied enough to blindly order another copy of it when
given the chance to try something new. 

My primary complaint about the `Das`_ was its ungainly size and awkward shape,
with the protusion in the upper right apparently tacked on solely to flaunt
the logo. I also wasn't convinced that the Cherry MX Browns were my favorite
type of key switches.

Switch Tester
-------------

To remedy my lack of firsthand knowledge about what a given actuation force
actually feels like in a key switch, I got this cool little `desk toy`_. There
are a variety of cheaper options allegedly available, but most were out of
stock at their respective suppliers when I ordered mine. 

That particular toy was interesting to me because it came with keycaps in the
4 profiles that Max Keyboards supplies. It also has o-rings, so you can
test the sound and feel of each switch type with them if you wish. The Max
keycaps are quite difficult to pull off of the switches, though, and the kit
does not come with a key puller tool.

From the desk toy, I concluded that I'd like a keyboard with a slightly higher
actuation force than the Cherry Browns. I also confirmed my impression that
keys with a tactile bump (browns and clears) are pleasant, but those with an
audible click as well (blues and greens) are far too loud to politely use in
an office setting.

Fancy Name-Brand Options
------------------------

I looked at Code keyboards, Max keyboards, and other models of Das. Prices
were consistently in the $130 range for an 87-key model with Cherry MX Clear
switches. 

I considered the prospect of building a keyboard from scratch, but the time
investment for researching parts compatability, assembling the components, and
figuring out the software build ecosystem seemed too daunting for an initial
commitment. I just want something to type on, not a robot. 

Curiosity and the Cheaper Option
