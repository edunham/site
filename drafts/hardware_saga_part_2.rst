Hardware Saga, part 2
=====================

My X201 arrived today! My first impression upon picking it up is how dense it
is for its size, which is how I felt about my X100e and X120e when I first got
them as well. The X201 feels a bit off balance, though, with its weight
concentrated in the battery at the back. 

Chassis
-------

It's got the solidity of the T61. The screen latches shut when closed and the
single slider to open it is just below the right palm rest. I haven't figured
out how to gracefully open the laptop with one hand yet.

The right side has (from back to front):

* Lock cable attachment
* HDD
* phone cable jack
* mic and headphone ports
* one USB 2.0 port

The front right side has a hole which looks like an SD card reader, and the
latch for the lid. Speakers appear to be on the bottom of the palm rest. 

The left side has (from back to front):

* Power jack
* fan vent
* USB port
* VGA port
* ethernet port
* yellow USB port
* wifi switch
* PCI-express slot

Screen
------

The hinges are tiny, perhaps 1/3 the width of those on the X230. However, the
cable to the screen is above the ThinkVantage button rather than running
through the hinges. 

The hinges are not quite as stiff as those on the X230, though they're
supported better when the laptop is closed because the screen latches shut. 

It's 2cm narrower than the X230's, so when I tile two borderless terminals
side by side, each one is 79chars wide when I take the font size down one unit
from normal. That's usable, though I'll probably want to move my color column
in Vim. 

It has a built-in webcam, and the embossed diagonal stripes ``\\\\\\\\\\
/////////`` so characteristic of older thinkpads above the screen.

There are indicator lights representing wifi, a capital Y with a bar atop it,
numlock, capslock, disk I/O, power, battery, and sleep status below the
screen, and power/battery/sleep lights on the outside. The X230 only had wifi
and disk I/O lights visible to the user, which made it easy to not notice when
the battery was critically low.  

Input
-----

It's a real ThinkPad keyboard, and thus a pleasure to type on. 

However, you cannot just pull keycaps off and push them back on again, as I'd
gotten accustomed to doing on the X230. The mod keys are about the same size,
and I wondered if I could swap them in order to have my cool Tux sticker
instead of the ugly Windows logo on this box. I pulled both keycaps off, and
discovered that the clips on the back which attach to the plastic scissor
mechanism are in slightly different positions for the two models. 

Getting the X201's mod key back together was immensely frustrating, since
removing the keycap causes the scissor assembly to come apart into two
separate pieces. When I tried to re-attach the keycap, I pushed it straight
down, which bent the tiny metal hooks that hold the pegs on the lower side of
the scissor thingy. I had to examine another key to figure out what was wrong,
then very gently bend the hooks back into shape with pliers. 

When I lifted the function key up to see how the little metal hooks work, one
of the tiny plastic pegs that forms the central axis of the scissor mechanism
snapped off. I got the key reassembled and it still works, but from a
disassembly perspective, it's infuriating how stiff and brittle the internal
plastic components of the keys are. 

Hard Drive
----------

The hole in the X201 is about 2mm larger than the thickness of my SSD, which
means I need to go find the little tray thingy that the SSD shipped with.
The excess space made it relatively difficult to fit the SSD's connector in
correctly, and I've currently stuffed a folded piece of paper above the drive
to keep it from moving around.
