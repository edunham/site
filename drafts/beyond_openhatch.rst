Beyond Openhatch
================

`OpenHatch`_ is a wonderful place to help new contributors find their first
open source issues to work on. Their training materials are unparalleled, and
the "projects submit easy bugs with mentors" model makes their list of
introductory issues reliably high-quality. 

However, once you know the basics of how to engage with an open source
project, you're no longer in the target audience for OpenHatch's list. Where
should you look for introductory issues when you want to get involved with a
new project, but you're already familiar with open source in general? 

An excellent `slide deck`_ by Josh Matthews contained several answers to this
question: 

* `issuehub.io`_ scrapes GitHub by labels and language

* `up-for-grabs`_ has an opt-in list of projects looking for new contributors,
  and scrapes their issue trackers for their "jump in", "up for grabs" or
  other "new contributors welcome" tags.

* If you're looking for Mozilla-specific contributions outside of just code,
  `What can I do for Mozilla?`_ can help direct you into any of Mozilla's
  myriad opportunities for involvement.



Am I missing your favorite introductory issue aggregator?
