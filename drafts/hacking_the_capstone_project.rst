Hacking the Capstone Project
============================

All engineering students at OSU have to complete a "capstone", or senior
design, project. These projects are a year-long endeavor, typically undertaken
in a student's fourth year of school. 

Here's some advice on the Computer Science capstone project that I've
followed, and some that I wish I had been given in advance. It may be
irrelevant or downright harmful to follow this advice for other majors.

Choose your team
----------------

If you plan ahead and find a "client" to submit a project proposal in August,
they can request that certain students be assigned to their project. Now that
Kevin McGrath is in charge of capstone, being requested by a client is the
**only** way that students can have any say in who they work with. 

Find a project early. Choose your team carefully. Help your "client" submit
the project proposal on time. Remember that the client needs to specify which
students they want **when they submit the proposal**. 

Read the directions
-------------------

The entire first term of capstone deals with a lot of bureaucracy for refining
the project's definition and implementation plan. 

Before you submit any assignment, pretend to be the TA grading it, and compare
it to the rubric. If your assignment fulfills all the requirements and you
make it **easy to grade**, you're practically guaranteed a good score. 

Be Pedantic
-----------

The first assignment during Winter term of capstone is to choose which
deliverables each student will be responsible for at Winter midterms, Winter
finals, and Spring midterms. 

A few extra minutes spent describing your deliverables in excrutiating detail
will save you hours and hours of extra work that would otherwise be required
to fulfill a vague, poorly scoped goal. 

For instance, if your requirement is "continuous integration testing", make it
explicitly clear that to fulfill the requirement, you will produce the URL at
which CI results can be viewed and at least one test which runs whenever code
is pushed. That way, if life gets out of control during the week that
deliverable is due, you can fulfill it with 10 minutes and TravisCI to get
full marks.
