--------------------------

since in the big picture it's the same problem as all others and the
deviations are in the small picture, the next step for getting nearer the
final state is more obvious

<that xkcd about time into scripting vs time saved>

ops is about over-estimating time saved and under-estimating time to script
it, because it's puzzles and toys and fun
