Why Ops?
========

My preferred vocation typically has words like "Operations Engineer" and
"DevOps" in its job posting titles. This means that I do whatevr it takes to
make a company's servers do what they should, and fix them when they
malfunction. 

During several conversations in my recent job hunt, people have asked me why
I'm interested in ops jobs. They've been everyone from a recruiter seemingly
skeptical of my ability to read the job posting for which I applied, to a
programming language researcher apparently confused by why anyone qualified
for a developer role would prefer operations, to a Director of Operations
claiming academic interest and curiosity about why anyone chooses the field.
