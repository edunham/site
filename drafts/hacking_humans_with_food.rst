Hacking Humans with Food
========================

`Homo Economicus`_ is the hypothetical "perfectly rational individual" upon
whose existance most modern economic theories are based. It's quite widely
known among people who pay attention to such things that real humans do not
behave in the ways that "pure rationality" would necessarily predict. 

These deviations from "strictly rational behavior" can make it hard to predict
the financial payoff of any particular action. However, this goes both ways:
Highly expensive attemps to curry favor can fall flat, but low-cost gestures
can have an unexpectedly powerful positive impact. 

I was recently flying with Delta air lines, and got to observe them achieving
the latter type of positive opinion management for a reasonably low up-front
investment in the same way on two occasions. 

On my first flight, departing around noon local time, the waiting area was
crowded with people stuck in the terminal waiting for a plane that had left
its previous airport several hours late. As well as the usual platitudes of
understanding the crowd's plight, the airline ordered sandwich lunches from a
deli in the airport and handed them out to everyone on the delayed flight.
When my second flight was delayed by about an hour around 7pm local time, the
airline similarly brought forth a little trolley loaded with snacks and drinks
of the sort which would be available on board the aircraft. The little trolley
was marked with signs saying something like "this is on us", and it wasn't the
first one I'd seen when walking through Delta's commonly used gates at that
terminal, which made me realize that this is probably their standard modus
operandi for placating individuals on delayed flights. 

Although they may not have thought it through quite like this, I've concluded
that the "give people food" trick works for two reasons: 

First, people get grumpy when they're hungry. We can be as enlightened as we
want, but we still live in bodies descended from our predecessors' milennia of
successful survival and reproduction, and those lacking the drives to
prioritize food are unlikely to have survived as competitively as those who
get increasingly ruthless as their blood sugar drops. 

Second, modern American consumers systematically overestimate the value of
"free". For a more detailed discussion of this quirk, see chapters #TODO FIXME
of #TODO AUTHOR's book `Predictably Irrational`_. 

How can the open source community leverage this category of hack? When you
look for it, many of us already are. Hackathons and meetup groups typically
attempt to entice attendees to their premises with free meals, `OpsSchool`_
rewards contributors with `a dozen cookies`_ for their 10th contribution, and
tipping links are often described as "buy me a coffee". 

An interesting follow-up to this observation would be to A/B test referral
links on various types of handouts at a company's conference booth. For
instance, hand out $5 gift certificate codes on candy wrappers, as stickers on
a free t-shirt, or on stress balls, and see a) which item gets taken the most
and b) what percentage of those items that get taken end up having their codes
redeemed. In the case of unique links, it would even be able to track how many
accounts which utilized the codes ended up converting to a paid subscription.
