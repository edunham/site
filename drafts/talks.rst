2015 talk ideas
===============

Why's My Program Slow? Algorithmic Complexity and You
-----------------------------------------------------

introduce big-O, big-omega, etc; examples of different ways to implement code
that're faster/slower, use common sense in small cases, overview of profiling
tools per-language

When you're new to programming, or self-taught with an emphasis on those
topics that are directly relevant to your current project, it's easy to skip
learning about analyzing the complexity of algorithms.  But when your pet
project runs too slowly, you find yourself wondering if there's anything you
can do to speed it up. This talk will minimize the scary math which often
accompanies formal computer science education, by using concrete examples of
what the mysterious greek letters mean and how understanding them can help
you. It will also include an overview of the profiling tools which
professionals use to analyze real code and understand its performance
problems.  

Community Management on Freenode
--------------------------------

Joining a FOSS project's leadership is rewarding, but if you haven't
participated in IRC channel administration before, the learning curve can be
daunting. Did you know that if you forget a vital step when creating a new
channel, you can end up stuck without the ability to register it? Can you
craft the right command to add a new project leader, without accidentally
banning them from your channel? This talk will cover those skills and more, to
keep you from having to find out the hard way. Focused on Freenode but
applicable to many other networks, we'll discuss what administrators do, how
to get ChanServ and other bots to do most of the hard work for you, and
techniques to foster the project culture that you're looking for.
