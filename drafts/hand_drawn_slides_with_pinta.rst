Hand-Drawn Slides with Pinta
============================

The `Human Hacking talk`_ that I'm giving at `SCALE`_ this weekend is a
variant of what I presented at `SeaGL`_ last year. I've made a variety of
improvements to it, including citing more sources, having better audience
participation questions, and re-doing the art for the slides. 

One of the thing I wanted to improve about my `SeaGL slides`_ was fixing the
inconsistency of the pictures that I used. I've found that slides with lots of
pictures and only a few words are the most powerful for my presentation style
-- they give the audience something to look at, without being overly
distracting. 

I've re-made my slides with `XKCD`_-style stickfigure drawings acting out the
core concepts of each section. Here's how my workflow has gone.

1) Pick a Scene
---------------

For my case study of "A project is ignoring my pull requests!", I decided to
draw some community members shunning a contributor who's offering them a bunch
of code.

    :align: center

2) Use Simple, Consistent Devices
---------------------------------

Throughout the presentation, I use a stack of parallel lines to represent a
code contribution. I got this idea from the XKCD what-if about `printing
Wikipedia`_. 

When it's important to be able to tell which direction characters are facing,
I try to choose ones with identifying marks on their heads (such as the
ponytail and hats). 

3) Utilize body language
------------------------

Remember that the figures' poses say a lot. A stick figure can emote through
the angle of its head, posture of its spine, and positions of its shoulders,
hips, elbows, and knees. You can also give them hands if gestures are
important, such as the "go away" raised palm. 

4) Marker and a Dead Tree
-------------------------

Draw each piece of the scene on a sheet of boring old printer paper. A sharpie
would work (though it may bleed through the paper and mark whatever's
underneath); I used a 1.5mm calligraphy pen that I found in my desk. 

The pieces of the scene don't need to be in their final positions right away.
I find it helpful to draw several versions of a difficult part, so that I can
pick the best one when I'm arranging them. 

5) Photo Time!
--------------

I used the back camera on my Nexus 5 to take an 8-megapixel image of each
page.
