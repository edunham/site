Big Data: Still Kinda Creepy
============================

Today, I ended up on LinkedIn's `people you may know`_ page and scrolled down.
I was greeted by a list of people whom, creepily enough, I know only in a
personal setting. This list includes my best friend's pen pal from middle
school, and the wife of one of my high school robotics mentors. I have 0
connections in common with either of these people, yet LinkedIn suggested them
to me.

I have never given LinkedIn permission to log into my email account, although
it encourages users to do "to help find connections". After reflecting on the
list of suggested users with no connections in common, I've come to suspect
that either:

a) All of those acquaintances chose to share their address books with
LinkedIn, and I was a contact, or 

b) LinkedIn used address book metadata or scraped mutual friends' history of
group emails to make suggestions between their acquaintances. For example,
perhaps A has B and C in his email contacts, and sent a group email to a list
of addresses including B and C. If LinkedIn knows this, it can conclude that B
and C are in some group together, and suggest them to one another as potential
connections.
