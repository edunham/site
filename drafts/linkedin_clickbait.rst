LinkedIn: Clickbait for recruiters
==================================

I get a reasonable amount of unsolicited email from recruiters on LinkedIn.
Some colleagues have it worse (and I don't envy them), but I personally get
around 2-3 recruitment messages per week describing opportunities that I might
concievably be interested in. 

Benefits of getting "spammed"
-----------------------------

The unsolicited emails from recruiters on LinkedIn are good for me in several
ways: 

* They provide a metric of which buzzwords are currently on hiring managers'
  minds. This is surprisingly useful: whether I'm helping a job-hunting friend
  with their resume, pondering how to best phrase a conference talk proposal,
  or even choosing between two otherwise-equivalent technologies to study.
 
* I get an ego boost from the flattery of being told my skills are in demand.
  This makes it harder to fall as far into impostor syndrome as I sometimes
  would without such feedback.

* Some recruiters disclose the salary of the positions they're trying to fill.
  This information improves my confidence that my current role is compensating
  me fairly for my skills, and helps me pinpoint the financial value that I
  place on intangibles like company reputation, technologies used at my job,
  and pleasant coworkers.

* They sometimes help me match a candidate-hunting company to a job-hunting
  friend who's a good fit. In my opinion, helping someone find the job they're
  looking for is one of the most valuable outcomes of "networking" -- the
  company wins by finding a suitable candidate, the friend wins by finding a
  good job, and I win by making a positive impact on both. 

* If I find myself looking for a new job, I can pick up those "not right now,
  but cool company" loose ends with old recruiters in order to maximize the
  number of relevant job leads available to me. Having second-choice companies
  available to interview with is a great way to practice interviewing.
  Multiple options also reduce the stress of an interview at your dream job:
  an interview is far less terrifying approached from a mindset of "if I screw
  up, I'll go to that other job with the benefits and salary that are only ok"
  than if you're in an "I have to do perfectly here because I have no other
  options" state of terror.

How to do it
------------

Have I convinced you that getting recruited at is worth a try? Conversely, if
you're currently inundated by recruiter spam and want it to go away, you might
try some of these tricks in reverse. 

* Describe what you do, with buzzwords. A good trick is to use archive.org to
  find the exact job posting you replied to when you got each job that you
  describe on LinkedIn. You can take some liberty with the titles, but each
  description should at least contain every technology name from the job
  posting. The little words in between don't seem to matter much; bulk
  recruiters don't even seem to care whether you've quantified your
  accomplishments. This is easier than writing a resume, folks. 

* Link to your GitHub. Publish an email address publicly on your GitHub
  profile. I get the occasional recruiter through there, as well. 

* Get friends to endorse you. That's right, "I worked with ``_name_`` at
  ``_company_`` their ``_trait_`` was ``_benefit to team_``" is a valid
  endorsement.

* Take some liberties with your job titles. Co-founded a thing, but the other
  people wandered off and you did all the work? It's ok to call that Founder. 
  Did you use a particular tool or technology? Note it.
