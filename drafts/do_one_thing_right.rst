Do one thing right
==================

When I built robots on `Team 847`_ back in high school, the team's mentors
helped me make the best of the unique opportunity to observe the same process
being repeated 4 years in a row. Each year, they encouraged us to analyze the
previous year's successes and failures. By the time I graduated, we had
refined the core of our design process into a deceptively simple mantra: 

**Do one thing, right, all the time**.

Do One Thing
------------

On the competition field, we saw many teams who tried to specialize their
robots to excel at every aspect of the game at once. However, the games were
simply too complex a problem to solve every part of in the 6 weeks we were
allotted. 

Those teams which focused on a single task and made no compromises in being
the best at that task seemed to inevitably excel. We discovered that it was
acceptable to try for secondary tasks, so long as nothing about our attempts
at them was permitted to hinder the primary task. 

Do It Right
-----------

Although the criterion of correctness may seem intuitively obvious, it's in
the nature of engineers to get caught up in "Wouldn't it be cool if...?" at
the potential expense of a more boring, pragmatic solution. Although those
brainstorming skills are critical in their part of the design process, they
need to be tempered with practicality and realism to avoid wasting too much
time. 

Another aspect of "doing it right" is for the whole team to agree on the
definition of both the target task and "succeeding" at it. For instance, if
the One Thing that the robot is going to do is "drive around the track", how
will you know when you've succeeded? Will you benchmark it on speed, or
maneuverability, or torque for shoving other bots out of the way? 

Essentially, one cannot "do it right" without clearly defining what "it" is. 

And Do It All The Time
----------------------

Our final realization was the importance of consistency and repeatability. Our
hardware and software had to be robust enough to perform the same at the
beginning and end of a weekend of abuse. 

Looking back, our focus on consistency was also a psychological gambit. Two
thirds of the teams in the final matches get there not through scoring the
most points, but by being selected by their alliance captains. It was in our
best interests to be the ally that another team would want, and consistency
was among the key traits we examined when selecting our own alliance partners.
