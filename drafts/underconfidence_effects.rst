Underconfidence Effects
=======================

There's this thing I've noticed, about how folklore among students works at
the OSL. I think it may offer one piece of the puzzle as to why these
high-achieving young computer scientists are so widely affected by impostor
syndrome, as well. 

Let's, for the sake of argument, suppose that technical skill is quantifiable.
Suppose each student's overall "how good they are" can be simplified into an
integer -- it can't, but students can and do attempt to compare their skill to
others', and integers are less nuanced to compare. 0 is a total novice; skill
increments by roughly one per year for an average student. 

So the founding member, A,  of the lab comes in and has a skill of maybe 2 when
they start. They stay around for a while, and in the lab's 4th year the
founding member has a skill of maybe 6 and leaves to go found a cool startup.
Simple enough. 

Let's look at what happens to the second generation of student, B. Say they come
in at the second year of the lab, with a skill level of 1. B works alongside
A, and they learn and grow together, and A's skill level is always about 3
above B's. 

Now it's year 4 of the lab, A is gone, B is in their second year (so their
skill is at 3 now), yet B remembers A as having always been at B+3 of skill. C
comes in, never really met or worked with A but hears stories. When C joins
the lab, their skill is at 2, and for their whole tenure there, B's skill is
C+1. C doesn't meet A, but C learns about A through B's stories, and C
concludes that transitively, A is at skill C+4. 

Now the fallacy comes in: C only hears about A's time as a student. The
picture that C has in their head of A is *a student* with a skill of C+4. By
the time C is ready to graduate (4 years after joining the lab), C's skill is
also at 6 (right where A's was when they left, too), but C is comparing
themself to this mental image of student A who must have been at skill level
10. 

That never happened. There was never a student with skill 10 at the lab, but C
lives in a reality where once-upon-a-time students were so much more skilled,
and so there's the illusion that the lab's going downhill every year. It
isn't.
