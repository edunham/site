Making Laptop Usable While Standing
===================================

So, I have this problem. My laptop is basically an extension of my brain, and
I keep it with me almost everywhere. My phone hasn't replaced it as much as I
originally expected it might, because I find touchscreens unpleasant to type
on. 

The problem is that laptops are designed for use on laps and tables, not for
holding in one hand and typing on with the other.

Perhaps surprisingly, I only have two major problems when trying to use my
laptop with one hand:

0) The problem of having nothing to hold onto when balancing the laptop on one
hand was incidentally solved when I switched from the 3-cell to the 9-cell
battery. The new battery sticks out perhaps 1.5cm from the back of the laptop,
and the ridges underneath it provide a good grip. 

1) I can't quite reach from the window key to the enter key. This means that
every time I want to command I3 to open a new terminal, I have to switch from
balancing my laptop on my left hand to having one hand on each side, in order
to get both the window key and the enter key at the same time. Then I risk
dropping my laptop when switching back to holding it in one hand and typing
with the other. 

2) When my login or VPS password is stored in the muscle memory of both hands,
it takes a disproportionately long time to hunt and peck it with one hand.
