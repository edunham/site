How do you know when a word is spelled incorrectly? 

Your brain tells you. 

What to you do when you don't know the correct spelling?

If I wrote in a GUI, perhaps I could mouse over the word and view the
program's automatic suggestions. If I was a better Vim wizard, perhaps I could
leave ``set spell`` in my ``.vimrc`` and tap out a magical incantation
starting with ``z`` every time a sequence of characters turned red, and get
suggestions that way. 

Back in elementary school or even middle school, before the world really
figured out how to leverage the benefits that Internet connectivity has to
offer, the teacher would have circled the word and perhaps jotted down the
correct spelling next to it. If it'd happened in chat, I would have
misspelled it and suffixed it with an (sp?) to tell my listener "yes, I know
it's wrong, but I don't know how to fix it". 

Now, my habitual reaction is to tab over to my web browser, pop open a new tab
with the Google homepage, and start typing some attempt at the word to see
what Autocomplete has to say about it. When the difficult word has some
homophones, the context of multi-word search suggestions helps me pick the
correct one. 

What if it goes wrong? What if I use an incorrect spelling with confidence,
and my listener doubts my credibility? 

They'll take my spelling of the word and Google it. 

They'll see more or less the same search suggestions, the same online
dictionary results in the first hits, as I did. 

But what if Google is "wrong"? 

The search algorithm is more or less a black box, and there are compelling
arguments about potential for abuse that say it should remain so.
