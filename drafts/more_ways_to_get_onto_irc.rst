More ways to get onto IRC
=========================

Years ago, I wrote an `IRC guide <http://lug.oregonstate.edu/blog/irc/>`_ for
my local Linux Users Group. Since then, some new software has been invented,
and I have learned more about the complaints that keep people from enjoying
the conventional IRC setups that I described.
