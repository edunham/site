Gamifying Adulthood with HabitRPG
=================================

After creating an account and abandoning it some time before August 2014
(since I have points for owning an account during a `boss quest`_ at that
time), I have returned to `HabitRPG`_. Here's a quick examination of why I
think I left and then came back.

Why Leave?
----------

The short answer is that I never really "got into it". I didn't have a
smartphone when I first created an account in the web UI, and it seemed at the
time like using the app would be prerequisite to successful gameplay. 

When I first got my phone, I installed the app, but I hadn't touched the web
UI in so long that I'd lost track of *why* the game was fun or rewarding. The
app's not super pretty, so when I wasn't motivated to touch it by an
understanding of the bigger-picture gameplay, I didn't choose to. 

Finally, I started playing with the app at a time when I more or less already
had my life under control. I didn't have any recurringly time-wasting habits
cutting into productive work that I was late on, my daily schedule worked out
quite well with room for everything I wanted to get done, and so forth. Such
is the beauty of "grownup" life, with a 9-5 job and not much else going on. At
that point, Ingress was my "I need to touch my phone a lot" game of choice,
and satisfied my vague desire for quantified/gamified reality.
