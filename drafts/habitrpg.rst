Gamifying Adulthood with HabitRPG
=================================

After creating an account and abandoning it some time before August 2014
(since I have points for owning an account during a `boss quest`_ at that
time), I have returned to `HabitRPG`_. Here's a quick examination of why I
think I left and then came back.

Why Leave?
----------

The short answer is that I never really "got into it". I didn't have a
smartphone when I first created an account in the web UI, and it seemed at the
time like using the app would be prerequisite to successful gameplay. 

When I first got my phone, I installed the app, but I hadn't touched the web
UI in so long that I'd lost track of *why* the game was fun or rewarding. The
app's not super pretty, so when I wasn't motivated to touch it by an
understanding of the bigger-picture gameplay, I didn't choose to. 

Finally, I started playing with the app at a time when I more or less already
had my life under control. I didn't have any recurringly time-wasting habits
cutting into productive work that I was late on, my daily schedule worked out
quite well with room for everything I wanted to get done, and so forth. Such
is the beauty of "grownup" life, with a 9-5 job and not much else going on. At
that point, Ingress was my "I need to touch my phone a lot" game of choice,
and satisfied my vague desire for quantified/gamified reality. 

Why return?
-----------

The game was brought to my attention in passing when I saw a friend playing it
a couple months ago, and its usefulness clicked into place for me when I
observed how much time I was spending on another online game called
`dominus`_. It's an open-source real time strategy type game, and the realtime
aspect of gameplay (as opposed to the immsersive, lose-hours-on-end nature of
my other bad habits like Minecraft) made me realize how easily and
unobtrusively I can fit a 5-minutes-at-a-time game into my workflow.

Now, if only I could turn those little brain breaks into something useful.
That's where HabitRPG fits in.

What It Is:
-----------

You should really go do the tutorial and read `the wiki`_ for any kind of a
comprehensive overview. In a hideously undersized nutshell, HabitRPG is a game
where you get items, gold, XP, and mana points by completeing tasks. Tasks
give you rewards (or harm you when incomplete) differently based on their
type:

* *Habits* are behaviors that you want to get more consistent at. They can
  either be positive, negative, or have both positive and negative buttons.
  Consistently plus-ing a habit turns it slowly green then blue; consistently
  minus-ing it turns it orange then red. Habits stay in your habit list until
  you delete them, no matter how often they're clicked.
    * Positive habits are "good" things and have only a ``+`` button, which you
      click when you do them. For example, "eat a vegetable".
    * Negative habits are things you're trying to avoid doing, and have only a
      ``-`` button. For example, "drinking soda".
    * Some habits have both ``+`` and ``-`` buttons. For example, you might
      put both buttons on "take the stairs instead of the elevator", and click
      on the ``+`` each time you take the stairs and the ``-`` each time you
      take the lift.
* *Dailies* are things that you want to do once every day, or on certain days
  of the week. Various game mechanics hurt you when you fail to complete all
  your daily tasks, or give you advantages when you complete all of them
  (called getting a *perfect day*). Dailies stick around until you delete
  them, and count the streak of how many times in a row you've gotten them.
* *To-dos* are how you quantify all those one-off things that need to get done.
  For instance, "Attend CS class" might be a daily for Monday, Wednesday, and
  Friday, but "Do CS class assignment 1" would be a to-do.

What It's Not
-------------

HabitRPG is not a replacement for Google Calendar. Although recurring "daily"
tasks can be set for certain days of the week, its deadlines feature just
doesn't get in your face the way a calendar email and notification will.

Although I'll discuss the ways that its game mechanics reduce the likelihood
of "do it eventually" tasks getting totally forgotten, I don't find HabitRPG
to match Google Calendar's ability to make me do an important, time-sensitive,
one-off task like attending an appointment.



Positive Tasks
--------------

i personally find it easier to be accountable on tasks that're either
postitive, or super concrete.like if i had a "don't eat junk food" i'd totally
ignore it, but "don't make impulse purchases on amazon" is ok



Good recurrence model
---------------------

paper checklists/calendars get lost and provide little motivation to repeat to
them

concrete-er rewards for streaks [link to that thing about Xs on calendar]


Partying
--------

* honesty
* accountability
* embarrassing to level too fast

Complexity
----------

I like studying game mechanics, what can i say

Moderation
----------

sometimes a task will make me feel really productive and so i'll do it a lot
when there are higher-priority things. it's bad game mechanic-ing to repeat a
blue item too often so it helps moderate me. 

Notes-To-Self
-------------

todos are just actionable notes; being in with the positive/fun/repeatable
stuff makes them more persistant

Timing
------

it's a low-guilt game to play when procrastinating, so it circumvents that
hiding from homework thing. google keep is totally passive and i rarely
remember it when bored; google tasks show up in email ie right when i'm
already trying to do something useful and don't have free cycles. good mix.

Emergent Weighting
------------------

i find that when i have a certain thing i need to do, the worse it seems the
more little tasks i'll break it into, and when i'm looking at my todo list,
i'll look for the most todos i can complete by only actually spending time on
one task.


Improvements?
-------------

* publish gold value on the task
