Gamifying Adulthood with HabitRPG
=================================

After creating an account and abandoning it some time before August 2014
(since I have points for owning an account during a `boss quest`_ at that
time), I have returned to `HabitRPG`_. Here's a quick examination of why I
think I left and then came back.

Why Leave?
----------

The short answer is that I never really "got into it". I didn't have a
smartphone when I first created an account in the web UI, and it seemed at the
time like using the app would be prerequisite to successful gameplay. 

When I first got my phone, I installed the app, but I hadn't touched the web
UI in so long that I'd lost track of *why* the game was fun or rewarding. The
app's not super pretty, so when I wasn't motivated to touch it by an
understanding of the bigger-picture gameplay, I didn't choose to. 

Finally, I started playing with the app at a time when I more or less already
had my life under control. I didn't have any recurringly time-wasting habits
cutting into productive work that I was late on, my daily schedule worked out
quite well with room for everything I wanted to get done, and so forth. Such
is the beauty of "grownup" life, with a 9-5 job and not much else going on. At
that point, Ingress was my "I need to touch my phone a lot" game of choice,
and satisfied my vague desire for quantified/gamified reality. 


Positive Tasks
--------------

i personally find it easier to be accountable on tasks that're either
postitive, or super concrete.like if i had a "don't eat junk food" i'd totally
ignore it, but "don't make impulse purchases on amazon" is ok

Good recurrence model
---------------------

paper checklists/calendars get lost and provide little motivation to repeat to
them

concrete-er rewards for streaks [link to that thing about Xs on calendar]


Partying
--------

* honesty
* accountability
* embarrassing to level too fast

Complexity
----------

I like studying game mechanics, what can i say

Moderation
----------

sometimes a task will make me feel really productive and so i'll do it a lot
when there are higher-priority things. it's bad game mechanic-ing to repeat a
blue item too often so it helps moderate me. 

Notes-To-Self
-------------

todos are just actionable notes; being in with the positive/fun/repeatable
stuff makes them more persistant

Timing
------

it's a low-guilt game to play when procrastinating, so it circumvents that
hiding from homework thing. google keep is totally passive and i rarely
remember it when bored; google tasks show up in email ie right when i'm
already trying to do something useful and don't have free cycles. good mix.

Emergent Weighting
------------------

i find that when i have a certain thing i need to do, the worse it seems the
more little tasks i'll break it into, and when i'm looking at my todo list,
i'll look for the most todos i can complete by only actually spending time on
one task.


Improvements?
-------------

* publish gold value on the task
