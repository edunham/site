Interview Questions: Greatest Weakness
======================================

Self-awareness questions like this are among the more awkward parts of the
traditional job interview process. When I'm prepping for interviews, I
sometimes like to read up on how others have answered such questions, as
reassurance that my own responses to such queries aren't totally outrageous. 

For that reason, I'd like to share my own answers to a few of the standard
interview questions, starting with the "greatest weakness" one.

A well-formed answer to the "greatest weakness" question can demonstrate not
only self-awareness, but also troubleshooting and problem-solving abilities.

You can also showcase your communication skills by wrapping it all into a
concise and well-presented summary, though that's something I'm personally
still working on. 

    "So edunham, what's your greatest weakness?"

>    Throughout my academic career, I've had difficulty with time management.
>    In particular, I've had a problem with committing to too many projects and
>    activities, which has harmed the quality and reliability of my
>    contributions to all of them. 
>
>    To deal with this, I've trained myself in the habit of keeping all my
>    major commitments in a single calendar. I've learned to realistically
>    assess what I can and can't fit into my schedule, which in turn prevents
>    me from committing to tasks that I don't have enough time to complete.
>
>    Looking back, that ability to say "no" is one of the most valuable time
>    management and leadership skills that I learned at university.

And there you have it! I'm surprised by how often this little anecdote
inspires the interviewer to tell a story of their own -- I think my "greatest
weakness" is actually extremely common among people like myself. 

To paraphrase a line of my Human Hacking talk which always makes the audience
laugh, after all, "leadership happens to people who are bad at saying no".
