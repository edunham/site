Bad Questions
=============


My invitation to be an "industry expert" on a panel for students to ask about
DevOps careers has gotten me thinking about what kind of questions to expect,
and what advice would have been most useful to me when I was in the students'
shoes.

One thing this brings to mind is the saying, all too often thrown around in
academia, that "There are no stupid questions, only stupid answers".
Unfortunately, anyone who's been subjected to a 101-level Computer Science
class containing a student with a 102 level of knowledge and a thirst for
attention can recognize that saying as bunk. I'm painfully aware of this
because I was that student -- it took me years to figure out how to ask
questions in a way that didn't needlessly inconvenience those around me.

So, to clarify the thing about questions: It's always okay to **have a
question**, but there are better and worse ways to go about **getting an
answer**. Following are a few pathological ways of asking perfectly valid
questions that I have personally learned to avoid.

Thinly Disguised Bragging
-------------------------

**Recognizing thinly-disguised-bragging questions in classes**:

Is this question only relevant, or would the answer
only make sense, due to something that the people in this class will learn
later in the standard curriculum?

**Recognizing thinly-disguised-bragging questions in general**:

If the question relies on a piece of knowledge that
you have and nobody else in the group does, **and** asking it in the current
context does not seem likely to have any impact on the decision or conclusion
that the group is working toward, you'll look like you're asking the question
to brag.

**The Problem**:

A question which both brags about the asker's knowledge and
doesn't benefit the other people who have to listen to it shows lack of
consideration for others. It makes the asker seem self-absorbed and generally
unpleasant to interact with, which in turn changes the way their peers choose
to treat them.

Questions asked in order to brag about subject knowledge in school also
exacerbate impostor syndrome in other listeners, which is harmful to the group
as a whole.

**How not to seem like you're asking a question just to brag**:

If you recognize that a question you were about to ask would brag
about your skills without helping any of the people who would have to listen
if you asked it now, write it down. Later, do some research on it and consult
an expert in a setting without a captive audience. Finally, blog about what
you learned -- a blog post showcases your intellectual prowess to those who
opt into hearing about it, while also giving you more space to explain why the
question is relevant and interesting.


LMGTFY
------

`LMGTFY <http://lmgtfy.com/>`_ stands for "Let Me Google That For You". I
split these "questions you should have searched for first" into 2 categories:

**I'm too lazy to type this out**:

Too-lazy-to-type questions are ones where the expert you're asking knows the
answer off the top of their head, but it takes more time to ask the expert and
get an answer than it would have to simply put the question into a search
engine and skim the first few hits.

**Please do research for me**:

I see please-do-my-research questions frequently on IRC, although they show up
from time to time when one works as a teaching assistant as well. This type of
question is characterized by asking an "expert" something that they would have
no reason to know about, in a way that forces them to search fo the question,
synthesize the results, and then explain them for you in little words.

**The Problem**:

LMGTFY questions of either type cause the person you're asking to view you as
inconsiderate of their time. Additionally, they suggest that giving you a good
answer will only encourage you to come back with more things that you should
have Googled first. One learns over time that befriending or encouraging
people who constantly ask LMGTFY-type questions is a bad idea.

**How not to seem too lazy to type**:

Sometimes search engines don't know of anything useful to you, or you lack the
context to phrase the question in a way that gets you good results -- in that
case, avert seeming too lazy to type by phrasing your question as "I've tried
to look up <search query> but keep getting results about <why the hits are
wrong>, could you tell me how <search query> relates to <thing you actually
wanted>?". Suddenly you seem extremely motivated and studious, rather than
disrespectful.

**How not to seem like you're demanding that someone do your research for
you**:

If you're asking a question that you know might be outside someone's area of
expertise, ask "Do you know <x> or know [what I should search | who I should
ask] to find out more?". This shows that you're thinking about their area of
expertise and planning ahead.

Additionally, flatter the person you're asking by remembering something
they've told you about their background, when you ask. For instance, "I'm
curious about <x>. Since you published that paper on <thing related to x>, I
thought you might know about it or be able to suggest who I should ask."

**If you just asked a LMGTFY question**:

Apologize. "Oops, my bad. I'll search first and ask questions later next time."

Or clarify politely: "Sorry, I should have mentioned that I already searched
it. I'm looking specifically for how <x> ties in with <y> without <z>; could
you suggest what I should search for to get more info on that?"


Inconsiderate Timing
