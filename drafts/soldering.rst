Teaching Soldering
==================

On several occasions over the past few years, I have found myself teaching
novices how to solder components onto circuit boards. I find that it rarely
takes someone more than about 10 minutes to get the basic idea, if I'm
teaching well. If I hurry, I fall into the trap of forgetting to tell them
important details, which sets them up for a more frustrating experience.

As a reminder to myself, the basic scripts I use to teach both through-hole
and surface-mount soldering are below the fold in this post. This is not a
complete guide for self-teaching; augment it with a YouTube video.

These outlines assume that the beginner has been handed a kit of parts and a
PCB (printed circuit board). They will usually have a physical or digital
diagram explaining where the parts go on the board, unless the silk screen
(the writing printed on the board) is uniquely thorough.

A beginner faced with a board containing both through-hole and surface mount
parts should try to solder the through-hole ones first.

Through-hole soldering
======================

If the part you're trying to solder has wire bits that stick out ("legs" or
"leads"), and the place you're trying to solder it onto has holes that go all
the way through the board, you are doing through-hole soldering.

Placing the component
---------------------

If all the bits that stick out of the part are already pointed in the same
direction, you don't need to bend them. If they stick out from the part in
different directions, such as the wires on a through-hole resistor, you'll
need to bend them so they fit through the holes in the board.

Some parts care which way around they go onto the board, and others do not.
Diodes and capacitors are directional -- bad things will happen if you put
them in backwards. You can tell which way around a directional part goes by
comparing the printing on the part to the printing on the silk screen.

LEDs have one leg longer than the other, and the longer leg is always the
positive side. My personal mneumonic is that the `+` side is longer than the
`-` because you would have to cut more wire to make a `+` than a `-` in the
same font.

Stick the component's wires through the holes where they belong, and turn the
board over so the component is underneath and the wires are pointing up at
you. Optionally, use a bit of electrical tape to hold the component in place
before you flip the board. Once the component has its legs though the holes,
you can bend them outward slightly so that that they hold the component in
place.
