keynotes
========

I do a lot of conference speaking. My usual algorithm for coming up with a
talk is "write an abstract that'll fill the room with people who're interested
in what I have to say, then deliver on those promises". This falls down
somewhat when the audience is roughly "all conference attendees".

To learn alternate algorithms that scale well to keynote talks, I've been
asking those experts whom I'm fortunate enough to run into.

pjf: Oh gosh. For me, keynotes are all about having content that's interesting
to the audience, but assumes no specific technical background at all, so
concepts and thought experiments trump specific tech. At OSCON everyone is
just so relieved it's not a "sponsored keynote" that I can do anything and the
audience likes it. :)

lxt: (cornered at lunch, so can't copy/paste)

    * question common knowledge, recombine information in an unexpected way.
    * More thought leadership than technical instruction

sarahsharp:

    * Be controversial, but back it up with facts.
    * For the SCALE diversity talk, I bet I spent 60+ hours on researching.
    * Be entertaining or thoughful. Use mostly pictures
    * I've got nothing on the topic selection though. :)
