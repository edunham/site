About
=====

I'm a `FOSS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software>`_
addict who dropped out of the Computer Science program at Oregon State
University to take an amazing job as a DevOps Engineer for Mozilla Research in
Portland, Oregon.

`FIRST <http://www3.usfirst.org/>`_ got me into robotics and programming back
in 2006, and I've been an amateur electrical and mechanical engineer ever
since. The `LUG <http://lug.oregonstate.edu/>`_ and `Open Source Lab 
<http://osuosl.org/>`_ started my career in open source software development
and Linux systems administration in 2010, and those topics have since become
my career.

I attended Oregon State University from September 2010 to June 2015.  In 2011
I spent my summer as a software developer on the Ganeti Web Manager project at
the OSU Open Source Lab; in 2012 I spent the summer doing Android software
development at Intel; in the summer of 2013 I was a sysadmin at the OSL, and
in 2014 I interned on the ops team at Urban Airship. 

As well as spending a couple terms as a teaching assistant and peer mentor for
the school of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 2013 and 2013, I
founded the OSL's `Devops BootCamp <http://devopsbootcamp.osuosl.org/>`_
sysadmin training program during the 2013-2014 school year and mentored its
new student leaders in 2014-2015.

* I'm ``edunham`` on ``irc.freenode.net``, ``irc.cat.pdx.edu``, and 
  ``irc.mozilla.org``. If it's `Google Summer of Code
  <https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/?csw=1>`_ or `Gnome OPW
  <https://wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen>`_ season, you might see me
  helping newbies on other networks as well.

* `GitHub <https://github.com/edunham>`_ links to most of my interesting
  public work.

* `LinkedIn <www.linkedin.com/in/dunhame>`_ might be useful for determining
  whether we know one another in real life.

* `StackOverflow Careers <https://careers.stackoverflow.com/edunham>`_ has
  blog posts I've written, as well as the usual resume stuff from LinkedIn.

* `Lanyrd <http://lanyrd.com/profile/edunham>`_ has a bit of my speaking
  history, with recordings.

* I'm **not** an active contributor to Twitter, Facebook, or Google+. Although
  I appreciate their usefulness, my personal involvement in the tech
  community's discussions fits better into IRC conversations, project issue
  trackers, blog posts, and so forth.
