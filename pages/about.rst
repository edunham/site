About
=====

I'm a `FOSS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software>`_
addict who dropped out of the Computer Science program at Oregon State
University to take an amazing job as a DevOps Engineer for Mozilla Research in
Portland, Oregon.

`FIRST <http://www3.usfirst.org/>`_ got me into robotics and programming back
in 2006, and I've been an amateur electrical and mechanical engineer ever
since. The `LUG <http://lug.oregonstate.edu/>`_ and `Open Source Lab 
<http://osuosl.org/>`_ started my career in open source software development
and Linux systems administration in 2010, and those topics have since become
my career.

I attended Oregon State University from September 2010 to June 2015.  In 2011
I spent my summer as a software developer on the Ganeti Web Manager project at
the OSU Open Source Lab; in 2012 I spent the summer doing Android software
development at Intel; in the summer of 2013 I was a sysadmin at the OSL, and
in 2014 I interned on the ops team at Urban Airship. 

As well as spending a couple terms as a teaching assistant and peer mentor for
the school of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 2013 and 2013, I
founded the OSL's `Devops BootCamp <http://devopsbootcamp.osuosl.org/>`_
sysadmin training program during the 2013-2014 school year and mentored its
new student leaders in 2014-2015.
