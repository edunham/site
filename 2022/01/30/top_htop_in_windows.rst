top/htop in windows is ctrl+shift+esc
=====================================

Helping a neighbor with a windows update issue today, I explained that asking a
Linux admin to use Windows is like asking a Latin speaker to translate a
document from Spanish. Most of the concepts are similar enough that they'll be
more helpful than a monolingual English speaker, but good guessing is not the
same as fluency. 

Since it was a problem with [good
directions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/-we-couldn-t-update-system-reserved-partition-error-installing-windows-10-46865f3f-37bb-4c51-c69f-07271b6672ac)
on how to fix it, the process mostly went smoothly. As I complained to a
Windows admin friend afterwards, it was fine except all the slashes in paths
were backwards, and I couldn't find the command prompt equivalent to Linux's
`top` or `htop`. 

My Windows friend pointed out the obvious solution to me: The windows
equivalent to `top` is not a command at all, but rather the task
manager GUI. Next time I need `top` or `htop` in Windows, I'll try to remember
to hit `ctrl+shift+esc` to summon that interface instead. 

And next time I'm searching the web for "windows command prompt top" "windows
equivalent of top command", and other queries that assume it'll let me live in
the terminal like my preferred operating systems, I might just end up back on
this very post. Hi, future me!
