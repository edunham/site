Moving on from Mozilla
======================

Today -- Friday, May 22nd, 2020 -- is within days of my 5-year anniversary with
Mozilla, and it's also my last day there for a while. Working at Mozilla has
been an amazing experience, and I'd recommend it to anyone.

There are some things that Mozilla does extremely well, and I'm excited to
spread those patterns to other parts of the industry. And there are areas where
Mozilla has room for improvement, where I'd like to see how others address
those challenges and maybe even bring back what I learn to Moz someday. 

Why go? 
-------

When I try to predict what my 2025 or 2030 self will wish I'd done with
my career around now, I anticipate that I'll want access to opportunities which
build on a background of technical leadership and mentoring junior engineers. 

It wouldn't be impossible to create these opportunities within Mozilla, but from
talking with trusted mentors both inside and outside the company, I've concluded
that I would get a lot more impact for the same effort if I was working within a
growing organization. 

As a mature organization, Mozilla's internal leadership needs are very
different from those of a younger and more actively growing company. There's a far
higher bar at Moz for what it takes to be the best person for a task, because
the saturation of "best people" is quite high and the prevalence of entirely new
tasks is relatively low in comparison. Technical leadership here seems to often
require creating a need as well as filling it. At a growing organization, on the
other hand, the types and availabilities of such opportunities are very different.

I'm especially looking forward to leveling up on a different stack in my next
role, to improve my understanding of the nuances of the underlying problems our
technolgies address. I think it's a bit like learning a second language: only
through comparing and contrasting multiple solutions to the same sort of problem
can one understand what traits corrolate to all those solutions' strengths
versus which details are simply incidental. 

Why now? 
--------

I'll be the first to admit that May 2020 is a really strange time to be changing
jobs. But I have an annual tradition of interviewing at several places, learning
what their stacks and cultures and unique fractals of tech debt look like, and
then turning down an offer or two because changing roles would be a step
backwards for both my career development and overall quality of life. 

Shortly before the global conference circuit ground to a halt along with
everything else, I started interviewing from a DevOps Advocate position, just to
explore what it might look like to turn my teaching hobby into a day job. By the
time those interviews were complete, the tech evangelism space had been turned
inside out and was rapidly reinventing itself, and the skills that qualified me
for the old world of devrel were looking less and less like the kind of
expertise that might be needed to succeed in the new one. However, a SRE from
the technical interviews suggested that I interview for her team, and upon taking
that advice I discovered an organization that keeps most of the stuff I loved
about Mozilla while also offering the other opportunities that I was looking
for. 

As with anywhere, there are a few aspects of my new role that I suspect may not
be as great yet as where I'm leaving, but these areas of improvement look like
things that I'll be able to have some influence over. Or at least there'll be
room to push the Overton Window in a good direction! 

Want more details on the new role? I'll be writing more about it after I start
on June 1st!
