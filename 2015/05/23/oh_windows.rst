Oh, Windows...
==============

I got a shiny new Thinkpad X1 Carbon 3rd Gen for my new job. It came with
Windows pre-installed. Out of morbid curiosity and willingness to consider
giving this shiny new allegedly-less-terrible Win8 thing a chance, I booted it
up into the default Windows installation before wiping everything to install
arch.

Windows: Hi there! Tell us a bunch of information!

Me: Okay... 

Windows: Log in to your Microsoft account!

Me: Can I skip this? I can't skip this? I have no such thing. Let's stick some
bogus credentials in and see how it fails. 

Windows: Aww, those credentials were wrong. Want to just skip this step?

Me: YES! I would swear that link wasn't there before. Okay... *sets up local
account*

Windows: I'm going to reboot now.

Me: Ah, good ol' classic Windows. 

Windows: *reboots quickly, then screen gradients from color to color while
installing apps*

Me: Whoa, trippy!

Windows: *shows relatively familiar-looking Windows-ey desktop*

Me: Hmm, my skills from middle school might still apply. *opens internet
exploder, goes to mozilla.com*

Windows: Here's the mozilla site! Here's a big button for downloading
Firefox.

Me: Thank you, Moz, for knowing that's why I'm here.

Windows: You wanna install this? You sure?

Me: Yes, sure I'm sure. Oh, and let's see if we can partition disks politely
from that little tool that used to be around here somewhere. *clicks the thing
where the start menu should be*

Windows: Hello human, I hear that humans find squares and bright colors
aesthetically satisfying! Here are many bright colors, and many squares!

Me: Ogod make it stop... they warned me about this... *slams window key*

Windows: Aww, okay, here's your desktop back.

Me: *types "windows 8 how to partition disks" into exploder address bar, since
ff is still downloading*

Windows: Here are some Bing hits for what you want! First one is some
disk-partition.com thing.

Me: Okay... *reads*... windows+r, type ``diskmanagement.msc``. Yay, it's
almost like a fake command prompt!

Windows: You have 5 partitions! 1,000MB, 260MB, 217GB Windows, 12.42GB Recovery, and 7GB OEM!

Me: Congrats. Let's delete that recovery stuff; I like living dangerously.

Windows: Nope. Not gonna show you those buttons; you might hurt yourself.

Me: Alrighty then, is there sudo or anything? *checks help docs*

Windows: Haha nope. Also, have an error about how you're trying to run the
system updater twice at once, even though you didn't invoke either. 

Me: Fine then, have it your way. *wipes entire disk and installs Arch Linux*
