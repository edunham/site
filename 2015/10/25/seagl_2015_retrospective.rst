SeaGL 2015 Retrospective
========================


As well as nominally helping organize the event, I attended and spoke at
`SeaGL`_ 2015 this weekend. The slides from my talk are `here`_. 

My talk drew an audience of perhaps a dozen people on Friday afternoon.
I didn't record this instance of the talk, but will probably give it at least
one more time and be sure to record then. 

One of the more useful tools I learned about is called `myrepos`_. It lets you
update all of the Git repositories on a machine at the same time, as well as
other neat tricks like replaying actions that failed due to network problems.
Its `author`_ has written a variety of other useful Git wrappers, as well.

Additionally, `VCSH`_ seems to be the "I knew somebody else wrote that
already!" tool for keeping parts of a home directory in Git.
