Interview on opensource.com
===========================

As part of my upcoming `talk at SCALE`_, I was `interviewed on
opensource.com`_. 

Nitish Tiwari interviewed me by email about my talk, then edited my comments
into what I feel like ended up as a very nice publication. I 
appreciate the CC-BY-SA license under which he released the article.
