Please License Your Code
========================

Code without a license isn't `open source`_. It isn't `free software`_,
either.     

Posting your code publicly doesn't inherently apply a license to it.

Adding a license really isn't hard -- it's just a label that clarifies the
owner's intent to share it. 

Imagine you come into the school cafeteria and there's a plate of cookies just
sitting on one of the tables. No sign on it, no indication of what they're
for, but they're out there in public. Is it ok to take one?

If you know the person who brought them, you can just ask if you can have one,
and they'll probably say yes. If some stranger brought them, then maybe
they're to share -- you can, and many people would, certainly take your 
chances and have one anyway. 

But what if they were put there by someone with malicious intentions and
access to unpleasant chemicals, or even just baked by someone well-meaning but
with extremely bad kitchen hygiene? 

Or maybe the art club has been making realistic cardboard cookies for an
upcoming play, or the veterinary students decided to decorate some dog
biscuits all festively, or...  you get the idea. 

You can, and many people would, just take your chances and have a cookie. Most
of the time, they're as wholesome and delicious as they look and were put
there by a nice person with a clean kitchen who intended to put a sign on them
but was just busy and forgot to, or assumed that everyone would know. But
every once in a while, that isn't the case, and then the aftermath involves
some awkward conversations or serious discomfort or even lawyers. 

Applying an appropriate license to your open source code is effectively just
putting a label by that plate of tasty solutions you've brought to the
internet, saying who they're for. 

.. note:: I am not a lawyer. I am not your lawyer. Please do not try to eat
    software, regardless of how it's licensed.
