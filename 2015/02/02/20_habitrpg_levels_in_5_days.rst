20 HabitRPG levels in 5 days
============================

I've been having fun with HabitRPG lately, and discovered this One Neat Trick: 

Checklists.

.. more::

Checklists, at least the way I've been using them, are obscenely overpowered.
I'll have a medium-difficulty to-do, break it down into a dozen sub-tasks
(because that's what I usually do on to-do lists when I'm procrastinating),
get them all checked off, and then reap a level and a half worth of `XP`_. 

According to that wiki page, 

    Experience gain is determined by an algorithm from HabitRPG, which tracks
    how consistently a player completes a given task. 

Cute theory. The thing is, I've never gotten more than maybe 20 XP from a
habit or daily (the only types of tasks for which consistency makes sense as a
metric), but I regularly get over 100 XP for the completion of a sufficiently
detailed checklist. 

Annoyingly, the wiki doesn't point out where the relevant algorithm lives in
the code. I've asked on IRC about how to find it, but for now, just try this: 

1) Make a to-do of a task that you'll have to do today. 

2) Add a checklist to the task, breaking it down into 8 or more necessary
sub-items. 

3) Accomplish your task, check each item, then check the main checkbox beside
its title. 

4) PROFIT!!
