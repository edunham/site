Apache Licenses
===============

At the bottom of the Apache 2.0 License file, there's an appendix::

    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
    
    ...

    Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]

    ...

Does that look like an invitation to fill in the blanks to you? It sure does
to me, and has `for`_ `others`_ in the Rust community as well. 

Today I was doing some licensing housekeeping and made the same
`embarrassing`_ `mistake`_. 

This is a PSA to double check whether inviting blanks are part of the appendix
before filling them out in Apache license texts.
