Questions about Open Source and Design
======================================

Today, I posed a question to some professional UI and UX designers:

    How can an open source project without dedicated design experts
    collaborate with amateur, volunteer designers to produce a well-designed
    product?

They revealed that they've faced similar collaboration challenges, but knew of
neither a specific process to solve the problem nor an organization that had
overcome it in the past.

Have you solved this problem? Have you tried some process or technique and
learned that it's not able to solve the problem? Email me
(``design@edunham.net``)  if you know of an open source project that's
succeeded at opening their design as well, and I'll update back here with what
I learn!

In no particular order, here are some of the problems that we were talking
about:

* Non-designers struggle to give constructive feedback on design. I can say
  "that's ugly" or "that's hard to use" more easily than I can say "here's how
  you can make it better".

* Projects without designers in the main decision-making team can have a hard
  time evaluating the quality of a proposed design.

* Non-designers struggle to articulate the objective design needs of their
  projects, so design remains a single monolithic problem rather than being
  decomposed into bite-sized, introductory issues the way code problems are.

* Volunteer designers have a difficult time finding open source projects to
  get involved with.

* Non-designers don't know the difference between different types of design,
  and tend to bikeshed on superficial, obvious traits like colors when they
  should be focusing on more subtle parts of the user experience. We as
  non-designers are like clients who ask for a web site without knowing that
  there's a difference between frontend development, back end development,
  database administration, and systems administration.

* The tests which designers apply to their work are often almost impossible to
  automate. For instance, I gather that a lot of user interaction testing
  involves watching new users attempt to complete a task using a given design,
  and observing the challenges they encounter.

Again, if you know of an open source project that's overcome any of these
challenges, please email me at ``design@edunham.net`` and tell me about it!
