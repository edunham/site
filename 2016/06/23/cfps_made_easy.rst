CFPs Made Easier
================

Check out `this post
<http://lucybain.com/blog/2016/conference-proposal-ideas/>`_ by Lucy Bain
about how to come up with an idea for what to talk about at a conference. I
blogged last year about `how I turn abstracts into talks
<http://edunham.net/2015/04/15/the_life_cycle_of_a_conference_talk.html>`_, as
well. Now that the `SeaGL CFP
<https://osem.seagl.org/conference/seagl2016/program/proposal/new>`_ is open,
it's time to look in a bit more detail about the process of going from a
**talk idea** to a **compelling abstract**.

In this post, I'll walk you through some exercises to clarify your
understanding of your talk idea and find its audience, then help you use that
information to outline the 7 essential parts of a complete abstract.

Getting ready to write your abstract
====================================

Your abstract is a promise about what your talk will deliver. Have you ever
gotten your hopes up for a talk based on its abstract, then attended only to
hear something totally unrelated? You can save your audience from that
disappointment by making sure that you present what your abstract says you
will.

For both you and your audience to get the most out of your talk, the following
questions can help you refine your talk idea before you even start to write
its abstract.

Why do you love this idea?
--------------------------

Start working on your abstract by taking some quick notes on why you're
excited about speaking on this topic. There are no wrong answers! Your reasons
might include:

* Document a topic you care about in a format that works well for those who
  learn by listening and watching
* Impress a potential employer with your knowledge and skills
* Meet others in the community who've solved similar problems before, to
  advise you
* Recruit contributors to a project
* Force yourself to finish a project or learn more detail about a tool
* Save novices from a pitfall that you encountered
* Travel to a conference location that you've always wanted to visit
* Build your resume
* Or something else entirely!

Starting out by identifying what you personally hope to gain from giving the
talk will help ensure that you make the right promises in your abstract, and
get the right people into the room.

What's your idea's scope?
-------------------------

Make 2 quick little lists:

* Topics I really want this presentation to cover
* Topics I do not want this presentation to cover

Once you think that you have your abstract all sorted out, come back to these
lists and make sure that you included enough topics from the first list, and
excluded those from the second.

Who's the conference's target audience?
---------------------------------------

Keynotes and single-track conferences are special, but generally your talk
does not have to appeal to every single person at the conference.

Write down all the major facts you know about the people who attend the
conference to which you're applying. How young or old might they be? How
technically expert or inexperienced? What are their interests? Why are they
there?

For example, here are some statements that I can make about the audience at
SeaGL:

* Expertise varies from university students and random community members to
  long-time contributors who've run multiple FOSS projects.
* Age varies from a few school-aged kids (usually brought by speakers and
  attendees) to retirees.
* The audience will contain some long-term FOSS contributors who don't
  program, and some relatively expert programmers who might have minimal
  involvement in their FOSS communities
* Most attendees will be from the vicinity of Seattle. It will be some
  attendees' first tech conference. A handful of speakers are from other parts
  of the US and Canada; international attendees are a tiny minority.
* The audience comes from a mix of socioeconomic backgrounds, and many
  attendees have day jobs in fields other than tech.
* Attendees typically come to SeaGL because they're interested in FOSS
  community and software.

Where's your niche?
-------------------

Now that you've taken some guesses about who will be reading your abstract,
think about which subset of the conference's attendees would get the most
benefit out of the topic that you're planning to talk about.

Write down which parts of the audience will get the most from your talk --
novices to open source? Community leaders who've found themselves in charge of
an IRC channel but aren't sure how to administer it? Intermediate Bash users
looking to learn some new tricks?

If your talk will appeal to multiple segments of the community (developers
interested in moving into DevOps, and managers wondering what their operations
people do all day?), write one question that your talk will answer for each
segment.

You'll use this list to customize your abstract and help get the right people
into the room for your talk.

Still need an idea?
-------------------

Conferences with as broad an audience as SeaGL often offer an introductory
track to help enthusiastic newcomers get up to speed. If you have intermediate
skills in a technology like Bash, Git, LaTeX, or IRC, offer an introductory
talk to help newbies get started with it! Can you teach a topic that you
learned recently in a way that's useful to newbies?

If you're an expert in a field that's foreign to most attendees (psychology?
beekeeping? Cray Supercomputer assembly language?), consider an intersection
talk: "What you can learn from X about Y". Can you combine your hobby,
background, or day job with a theme from the conference to come up with
something unique?

The Anatomy of an Abstract
==========================

There are many ways to structure a good abstract. Here's how I like to
structure them:

* Set the scene with an introductory sentence that reminds your target
  audience of your topic's relevance to them. Some of mine have included:

    * "Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast,
      prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety."
    * "Git is the most popular source code management and version control
      system in the open source community."
    * "When you're new to programming, or self-taught with an emphasis on those
      topics that are directly relevant to your current project, it's easy to
      skip learning about analyzing the complexity of algorithms."

* Ask some questions, which the talk promises to answer. These questions
  should be asked from the perspective of your target audience, which you
  identified earlier.
  This is the least essential piece of an abstract, and can be
  skipped if you make sure your exposition clearly shows that you understand
  your target audience in some other way. Here are a couple of questions I've
  used in abstracts that were accepted to conferences:

    * "Do you know how to control what information people can discover about
      you on an IRC network?"
    * "Is the project of your dreams ignoring your pull requests?"

* Drop some hints about the format that the talk will take. This shows the
  selection commitee that you've planned ahead, and helps audience members
  select sessiosn that're a good fit for their learning styles. Useful words
  here include:

    * "Overview of"
    * "Case study"
    * "Demonstrations of"
    * "Deep dive into"
    * "Outline X principles for"
    * "Live coding"

* Identify what knowledge the audience will need to get the talk's benefit, if
  applicable. Being specific about this helps welcome audience members who're
  undecided about whether the talk is applicable to them. Useful phrases include:

    * "This talk will assume no background knowledge of..."
    * "If you've used ``____`` to ``____``, ..."
    * "If you've completed the ``____`` tutorial..."

* State a specific benefit that audience members will get from having
  attended the talk. Benefits can include:

    * "Halve your Django website's page load times"
    * "Get help on IRC"
    * "Learn from ``____``'s mistakes"
    * "Ask the right questions about ``____``"

* Reinforce and quantify your credibility. If you're presenting a case study
  into how your company deployed a specific tool, be sure to mention your role
  on the team! For instance, you might say:

    * "Presented by [the original author | a developer | a maintainer | a
      long-term user] of [the project], this talk will..."

* End with a recap of the talk's basic promise, and welcome audience members
  to attend.

These pieces of information don't have to each be in their own sentence -- for
instance, the credibility reinforcement and talk format hint often fit
together nicely.

Once you've got all of the essential pieces of an abstract, munge them around
until it sounds like concise, fluent English. Get some feedback on

Give it a title
===============

Naming things is hard. Here are some assorted tips:

* Keep it under about 50 characters, or it might not fit on the program
* Be polite. Rude puns or metaphors might be eye-catching, but probably
  violate your conference or community's code of conduct, and will definitely
  alienate part of your prospective audience.
* For general talks, it's hard to go wrong with "Intro to ``___``" or "``___``
  for ``___`` users".
* The form "[topic]: A [history|overview|melodrama|case study|love story]" is
  generally reliable. Well, I'm kidding about "melodrama" and "love story"...
  Mostly.
* Clickbait is underhanded, but it works. "``___`` things I wish I'd known
  about ``___``", anyone?

Good luck, and happy conferencing!
