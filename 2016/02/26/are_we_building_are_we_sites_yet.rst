Are we 'are we' yet?
====================

The Rust community, being founded and enjoyed by a variety of Mozilians, seems
to have inherited the tradition of tracking top-level progress metrics using
`are we`_ sites.

* `Are we concurrent yet?`_ tracks the progres of Rust's concurrency ecosystem
* `Are we web yet?`_ tracks the status of Rust's HTTP stack, web frameworks,
  and related libraries
* `Are we IDE yet?`_ provides a list of what features are supported for Rust per
  IDE, and links to the relevant tracking issues and RFCs

If this blog post was an 'are we' page itself, the big text at the top would
probably say "Getting There".
