More on Mentorship
==================

Last year, I `wrote <http://edunham.net/2018/08/24/job_move.html>`_ about some
of the aspirations which motivated my move from Mozilla Research to the
CloudOps team. At the recent Mozilla All Hands in Whistler, I had the "how's
the new team going?" conversation with many old and new friends, and that
repetition helped me reify some ideas about what I really meant by "I'd like
better mentorship".

To generalize about how mentors' careers affect what they can mentor me on, I've sketched
up a quick figure in order to name some possible situations that people can be in relative
to one another:

The first couple cases of mentorship are easy to describe, because I've experienced and
thought about them for many years already: 

Mentorship across industries
----------------------------

Mentors from outside my own industry are valuable for high level perspectives, and for
advice on general life and human topics that aren't specialized to a single field.
Additionally, specialists in other industries often represent the consumers of my own
industry's products. Wise and thoughtful people who share little to none of my domain
knowledge can provide constructive feedback on why my industry's work gets particular
reactions from the people it affects -- just as someone who's never read a particular book
before is likely to catch more spelling errors than its own author, who's been poring over
the same manuscript for many hours a day for several years. 

However, for more concrete problems within my particular career ("this program is running slower
than expected", or even "how should I describe that role on my resume?"), observers from outside of
it can rarely offer a well tested recommendation of a path forward. 

Mentorship across companies within an industry
----------------------------------------------

Similarly, mentors from other companies within my own industry are my go-to source of
insight on general trends and technologies. A colleague in a distant corner of my field
can tell me about the frustrations they encountered when using a piece of technology that
I'm considering, and I can use that advice to make better-informed choices in
my daily work. 

But advice on a particular company's peculiarities rarely translates well across
organizations. A certain frequency of reorganization might be perfectly ordinary at my
company, but a re-org might indicate major problems at another. This type of education,
while difficult to get from someone at a different company, is perfectly feasible to pick
up from anyone on another team within one's own organization. 

Mentorship across teams within a company
----------------------------------------

When I switched roles, I had trial-and-errored my way into the observation that there's a
large class of problems with which mentors from different teams within the same company
cannot effectively help. I'd tentatively call these "junior engineer problems", as having
overcome their general cases seems to correlate strongly to seniority. In my own
expeience, honing the improvement of code-adjacent skills such as the intuition for what
problems should be effectively solvable from the docs versus when and whom to ask for
help, how deeply to explore a prospective course of action before committing to it, and
when to write off an experiment as "effectively impossible", are all questions whose
answers one derives from experience and observing expert peers rather than from just
asking them with words. 

Mentorship across projects or specialties within a team
-------------------------------------------------------

I had assumed that simply being on the same team as people capable of imparting that
highly specialized variant of common sense would suffice to expose me to it. However, my
first few projects on my new team have clearly shown, in both the positive and the
negative cases, that working on the same project as an expert is far more useful to my own
growth than simply chancing to be bureaucracied into the same group. 

The negative case was my first pair of projects: The migration of 2 small, simple services
from my team's AWS infrastructure to GCP. Although I was on the same team as experts in
this process, the particular projects were essentially mine alone, and it was up to me to
determine how far to proceed on each problem by myself before escalating it to interrupt a
busy senior engineer. My heuristics for that process weren't great, and I knew that at the
outset, but my bias toward asking for help later than was optimal slowed the process of
improving my ability to draw that line -- how can one enhance one's discrimination between
"too soon", "just right", and "too late" when all the data points one gathers are in the
same one of those categories?

Mentorship within a project
---------------------------

Finally, however, I'm in the midst of a project that demonstrates a positive case for the
type of mentorship I switched teams to seek. I'm in the case labeled A on the diagram up
above -- I'm working with a more-experienced teammate on a project which also includes
close collaboration with members of another team within our organization. In examining why
this is working so much better for me than my prior tasks, I've noticed some differences:
First, I'm getting constant feedback on my own expectations for my work. This is no
serious nor bureaucratic process, but simply a series of tiny interactions -- expressions
of surprise when I complete a task effectively, or recommendations to move on to a
different approach when something seems to take too long. Similarly, code review from
someone immersed in the same problem that I'm working on is indescribably more
constructive than review from someone who's less familiar with the nuances of whatever
objective my code is trying to achieve.  

Another reason that I suspect I'm improving more quickly than before in this particular
task is the opportunity to observe my teammate modeling the skills that I'm learning in
his interactions with our colleagues from another team (those in position C on that
chart). There's always a particular trick to asking a question in a way that elicits the
category of answer one actually wanted, and watching this trick done frequently in
circumstances where I'm up to date on all the nuances and details is a great way to learn. 

The FOSS loophole
-----------------

I suspect I may have been slower to notice these differences than I otherwise might have
been, because the start of my career included a lot of fantastic, same-project mentorship
from individuals on other teams, at other companies, and even in other industries. This is
because my earliest work was on free and open source software and infrastructure. In FOSS,
anyone who can pay with their time and computer usage buys access to a cross-company,
often cross-industry web of professionals and can derive all the benefits of working
directly with mentors on a single project. I was particularly fortunate to draw a wage
from the OSU Open Source Lab while doing that work, because the opportunity cost of a
hours spent on FOSS by a student who also needs to spend those hours on work is far from
free.
